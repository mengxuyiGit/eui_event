Happy Hacktoberfest!

If it's your first one, don't worry! I've been in your shoes and tried to make it super easy and friendly to contribute to!

Just read the guidelines below, then peruse open issues, or create your own if you have ideas!

Please read the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/brittanyjoiner15/eui-event/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Want to contribute?

This project is built on Elastic UI with React. If you want to contribute, you can do so in a couple of ways!

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Submitting a fix for a bug
- Creating a pull request for an open issue
- Review the docs and make a pull request for any improvements

## Reporting bugs or proposing new features

See something broken or have an idea to improve the site? Create a new issue.

If it's a bug...

- Explain the bug and WHERE you saw it (the page, section on the page)
- Explain what you expected to happen
- Describe how we can reproduce it
- Note your browser and device
- Bonus points if you can share a screenshot or recording!

If it's a feature...

- Describe the ideal state of what the feature would do in one sentence. _(Use language like "As a user, I can ....")_
- Explain in more detail what that might look like.
- Add a link to any examples that you can share that demonstrate this feature.
- Bonus points if you can also explain _how_ to implement this!

## Contributing Pull Requests

### Step 1: Pick an issue and get assigned

**!! Please don't start with a pull request!** Please look for open issues, comment on one, and wait to be assigned before starting on it.

If you find an open issue you'd like to work on, add a comment, and I'll assign it to you. Once you're assigned, you can start developing!

**!! Important!!** Please don't request an issue then ghost me!

If you comment on an issue requesting it, I will assign you. After you're assigned, please respond within 2 days to let me know you're working on it or you've completed it. _(Not a problem if you haven't completed it! Just need to know you're still interested in it)_ If I don't hear from you within those first 2 days, I'll comment and check for the status, and if I still don't hear from you within a day, I'll likely re-assign the issue. But don't worry - you can always grab another one!

Note - at this time, we'd only like folks to be assigned _one_ issue at a time, unless there's an exception where two issues are very related, but in most situations please request one issue at a time. Once you complete that issue and the PR is merged successfully, you'll be welcoome to request another one! (I review pretty quickly and shouldn't be holding you up too long!)

### Step 2: Get the repo running locally

1. Click the "fork repo" button at the top of the menu, then select your profile, and name it (you can stick with the default name or call it something else).
2. After you fork the repo, add it to your local machine. _I find this easiest to do by downloading the GitHub Desktop app and then selecting the "Open with GitHub Desktop" option._
3. Open a terminal and cd to the repo.
4. Once there, run `yarn install` to install all the dependencies
5. Run `yarn start` to start the server
6. Go to `localhost:3000` and view it!

_If you have any problems doing this, please create an issue and tag me with `@brittanyjoiner15`, or [DM me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/britt_joiner)._

### Step 3: Write your code

Now just open the repo directory in your code editor of choice _(I prefer VSCode.)_ And start writing code to solve your issue!

**Optional step: Create a new branch to keep track of your changes instead of committing to main. I don't typically do this on a forked version of a branch, but some might disagree. If you're comfortable with it and want to do it, go for it. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, ignore this whole paragraph and carry on. :)**

_If you get stuck and need ideas, the developer community is super helpful. You can create a post on a forum, or you can reach out to me by adding a comment on the issue._

### Step 4: Open a pull request

Once you've created your code changes, make sure you've saved them locally.

When you're ready to share your changes, you'll need to

- Check for unstaged stages (run `git status`)
- Add your changes (assuming you want to add all the ones that were just shown after checking the status, run `git add .`)
- Commit them (run `git commit -m 'some message here about what you changed`)
- Push them to your github repo (this step depends if you created a new branch or if you're on main/master. If you created a new branch, you only did so because you know what to do (aka run `git push --set-upstream origin ADD_BRANCH_HERE` to publish your branch)! If you didn't create a new branch, just run `git push`)

Now head to your forked repo on Github (where we started in Step 1, if you forget, it's github.com/yourusername/your-directory-name).

Once there, you should see a button that says there have been changes and a "Compare and pull request" button next to it. Click that button, and if you don't see it, you should see another message that says this fork is 1 commit ahead of the fork. Select the contribute button, and then "open pull request", then fill out the info.

**Pull Request template**

- [ ] The **title** should be something descriptive about what your changes do. _(It will default to whatever you put as your commit message.)_
- [ ] The **description** should include ...
  - [ ] A short summary of your changes
  - [ ] A link to the issue that relates to these changes
  - [ ] A screenshot of the changes if possible!
- [ ] Add `brittanyjoiner15` as a reviewer
- [ ] Add yourself as an assignee

Anything else is optional! If you see labels that work, feel free to add them, but otherwise, you can leave them blank.

When you've done the above, select the "Create pull request button", and that's all for now!

ðŸŽ‰ Take a minute to celebrate!!

### Final Step: Wait for the review and make any requested changes

I'll take a look at your PR and make any recommended changes, or let you know it's good to go!

If I request changes, please try to get to them as soon as you can. _(Trust me- this is for your benefit too as merge conflicts can be very frustrating for everyone.)_

Once it's been approved, I'll go ahead and merge it!

Celebrate, and if you're up for it, grab another issue!
